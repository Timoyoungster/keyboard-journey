# Notes
## Failed Ideas
- screwing a plate onto the bottom piece to hold the PCB doesn’t work because the Elite-PI is on the edge
- using cylindrical extrusions to fit the top to the bottom doesn’t work because the cylinders break easily when a bit of rotational force is applied
- using velcro to attach the PCB to the bottom piece doesn’t work as it makes the PCB feel mushy and if the Elite-PI’s side is pressed down it could damage the cables/ports

## WIP Ideas
### attaching the top to the bottom piece
- embedding magnets into the top and bottom piece to keep the surfaces clean and still hold them together tightly (maybe using longer rectangular shaped ones would be better than circular ones)

### fixating the PCB to the bottom piece
- drill mounting holes if the PCB is not destroyed by doing so, and screw it to the bottom whilst keeping it off the floor with standoffs

### making space for the cables
- if possible let the PCB sit higher than the bottom piece’s wall, so that there is enough room for the USB-C and AUX cable
- else make a big enough cylindrical “dent”/cutout for the aux port and a similar one in USB-C shape
